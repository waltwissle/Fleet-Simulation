# Fleet-Simulation
This a simulation of a naval fleet using a flexible and extensible object oriented architecture in python through abstract base classes.

The architecture consits of three abstract base classes,
1. Vessel which specified behaviour for vessels
2. Powerplants which specifies behaviour for powerplants
3. Weapons which specifies behaviour for weapons
